Over the past days I've been coming out as transsexual to my friends. They were all very supportive as I have expected.
 
Family is a different issue. I've been on a family meetup yesterday and I was told to hide the issue to everyone except my sister (my parents knew before). Had some nice calm talk with her, although not feeling to be understood.

At the end of the day *hiding* myself I had a bad case of anxiety and social phobia. Next time I will either not attend or come out to everybody...

At this moment I really regret living in the same house as my parents. While I have a whole floor for myself, they have troubles adapting quickly and especially my mom is always working against me.

At least now there's some distraction coming up, going to 31C3 tomorrow.
